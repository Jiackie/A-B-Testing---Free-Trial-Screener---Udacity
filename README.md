# A-B-Testing---Free-Trial-Screener---Udacity

A/B testing is a methodology used online when you want to test a feature or new product’s performance. Udacity plans to improve the entire enrolled student experience and coaches’ capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course by adding a time-spent-on-course feature (Free Trial Screener). This project aims at analyzing two versions of Udacity’s website (experience group and control group), and determine whether the new feature should be launched in order to reduce the number of students who left the free trial because of the time issue. This project includes metrics choice, measuring variability, sizing, sanity checks, analysis, recommendation, and the follow-up experiment. Data used in this project was given by Udacity.
