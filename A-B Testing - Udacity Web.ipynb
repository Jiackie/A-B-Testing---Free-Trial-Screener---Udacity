    "A/B testing is a methodology used online when you want to test a feature or new product’s performance. Udacity plans to improve the entire enrolled student experience and coaches’ capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course by adding a time-spent-on-course feature (Free Trial Screener). This project aims at analyzing two versions of Udacity’s website (experience group and control group), and determine whether the new feature should be launched in order to reduce the number of students who left the free trial because of the time issue. This project includes metrics choice, measuring variability, sizing, sanity checks, analysis, recommendation, and the follow-up experiment. Data used in this project was given by Udacity. "

Gross conversion is a good metric to track the number of users enrolled in the free trial and Net conversion metric could help us to check the number of users who still remain in the course.

Students in the experiment group are asked how much time they had available to devote course if they want to start a free trial and students in the control group are continually enroll without any suggestion as usual. We use three invariant metrics for sanity check and two evaluation metrics for size and sign test check. Our expectation is to reduce the number of students who do not have enough time spending on Udacity study in order to increase the other student’s education experience which means we want a decrease in gross conversion and an increase in net conversion. We didn’t use Bonferroni correction because it is too conservative to have a reasonable alpha. In this case, the risk type I error (false positive) and type II errors (false negative) increase as the number of metrics increases, and change the final decision.\n",
